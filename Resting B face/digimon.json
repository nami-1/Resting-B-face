Its fur has become like ice crystals, and is said to be as hard as Chrome Digizoid. With the morning star \"Mjöllnir\" it carries on its back, it can annihilate a mountain in one swing, distorting space itself. It manages the Ikkakumon and Zudomon corps, and though in the midst of battle it appears as a heartless berserker, it shows a face of great compassion for its subordinates. Its Special Move \"Arctic Blizzard\" momentarily brings the surrounding atmosphere to absolute zero, flash-freezing the opponent, who it then smashes with Mjöllnir. That the opponent's smashed body becomes like a blizzard is what gave it the name. "}],"skills":[{"id":159,"skill":"Berserk Howl","translation":"","description":"Howls with all of its berserker rage.
